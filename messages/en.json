    "bio": "I love creating new things through coding. I have always been a builder. From building LEGO blocks in my childhood and being a musician to programming, I have always enjoyed creating something new. I chose JavaScript for the possibility of building isomorphic applications and for having all the building blocks in place, such as frameworks, packages, and other tooling. Initially, I was focused on the frontend, but as my curiosity grew, my interest expanded to the broader ecosystem. I gained robust experience in the modern web dev by working for startup companies. I stay up to date with new technology because of my curiosity and passion for coding. So here I am, ready to share my experience and my journey through software development."
