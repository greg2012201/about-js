    "bio": "I love creating new things by coding. I have always liked 'front side' of the cyber world. I have been coding since march of 2020. Before, I've always been curious about how user interfaces work behind the scenes and how I can create them from a blank page in the code editor. I'm fascinated in React, before I met this library I have been coding in vanilla JS. When I started learning React I felt tons of possibilities. I'm a big fan of Next.js with React Server Components. I like taking on difficult programming challenges."
